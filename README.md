The table includes the following columns:
- **MC Rank**: Market Cap Rank
- **Ticker**: Ticker symbol of the cryptocurrency
- **Market Cap**: Market capitalization of the cryptocurrency
- **Volume**: 24-hour trading volume of the cryptocurrency
- **Volume/Market Cap**: Ratio of 24-hour trading volume to market capitalization

The column headers are clickable, allowing you to sort the data in ascending or descending order based on the selected column.
